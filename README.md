# Calculator-Addons
This is a collection of addons I coded for my school calculator.

# Description
"Mathematicians are lazy!" -My Math Teacher ... Because of that I thougt I should code this so I don't have to do these things by myself. It's probably not allowed in major test but yeah. I used the Casio fx-9860G3. More things will be added over time. I don't recommend cheating in exams or any other test with this.

# Setup
1. Connect the calculator with the usb cable to any usb port on your pc
2. Press the F1 key on your calculator
3. Open the calculator in your file Manager on your pc (it's the same as putting a file on a usb stick)
4. Open the Folder: @MainMem
5. But the main.py in there
6. Disconnect the calculator on your pc DON'T JUST RIP OUT THE CABLE! (If you struggle with this step, just take a look on your calculator it gives you the instructions after waiting a bit)
7. If you have done it right you should see a text on your calculator that says something like: "Finished"
8. You can pull out the cable now
9. You can run the script under the PYTHON Tab in your Menu

# How to use
With running the main.py you will be asked what you want to do. Everything is choosen by pressing the corresponding number. Your Options are showed like this: 

[option] : [corresponding number]

Example: we:1 stands for the option we -> weight and you can choose it with the number 1

All short cuts:
* we -> weight
* mg -> milligrams
* gr -> gram
* kg -> kilogram
* to -> tons
* ou -> ounce
* po -> pound
